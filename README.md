# Apartment Application

April 2024

This is an instructional project for LEARN Academy, a web development bootcamp. The purpose of this application is to allow students to make a decoupled full-stack application with user authentication and authorization. The frontend is a React app that makes requests to a separate Rails API using JWT for authentication. The Rails API uses Devise for authentication and authorization.

### 🏡 Apartment App Project Description

Apartment App is a decoupled, full-stack application in React with a Ruby on Rails API that lists apartments available for rent. A visiting user of the application can see a list and of all available apartments. A visiting user can select one apartment and see more details. To list an apartment for rent, a user can create an account and log into the application. A logged in user can add a new apartment and see a list of all their apartments with the ability to edit or delete their own listings.
